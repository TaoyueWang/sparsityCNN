TU Delft CS4240 Deep Learning Reproducibility Project: Sparsity Invariant CNNs

* Some of the code is referred from: https://github.com/chenxiaoyu523/Sparsity-Invariant-CNNs-pytorch, and has been authorized to be used in public.
* This project aims at reconstructing part of the work in this paper: Uhrig J, Schneider N, Schneider L, et al. Sparsity invariant cnns[C]//2017 international conference on 3D Vision (3DV). IEEE, 2017: 11-20.
  
* The "Caltech-101" file:_ Nonsparse.ipynb_ and _Sparse.ipynb_ contain complete codes to implement the Sparse ConvNet and normal ConvNet for Caltech-101 dataset. _caltechdataproc.ipynb_ contains the python code to test different sparsity levels and make plots. The Caltech-101 dataset is an open dataset and can be downloaded freely on the website: https://data.caltech.edu/records/mzrjq-6wc02

* The "mnist" file: _Mnist_Conv.ipynb_ and _Mnist_SparConv_ contain complete codes to implement the Sparse ConvNet and normal ConvNet for MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset can be unzipped in data.zip.
